                            <p>I'm a native of the Midwest from the amazing city of Chicago, IL. During my formative years, I acquired my primary education in Altheimer and Pine Bluff, AR graduating from Pine Bluff High in 2002. The summer of that year, I moved back to my hometown of Chicago where I completed my undergraduate degree in Biomedical Science with prior aspirations of attending medical school to follow. However, in the course of preparing for what the carrer expected of me, I discovered being a clinical physician was not quite where my interests lay. So, what was next? A flight to London with a two year stay abroad while completing my Master's degree in Biomedical Research. Afterwards, I returned to Chicago once again and began my journey as a fully independent, student loan burdened, professional career woman.</p>
